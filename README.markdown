Setting Up
==========

Copy config/application.xml.example to `config/application.xml`.

Create a MySQL database and import `config/db-schema.sql` into it. Update 
`config/application.xml` database connection paramters to use the new database.

Copy `sample-data` folder to `my-data` folder. You can put files in this 
directory to run the monitor script on since this folder is ignored by Git.
